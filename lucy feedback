lucy feedback, 

in about Styles section:
refers to "them" and "they", maybe its just because I am family but I would be inclined to write "we" as it gives a more personal impression. Or perhaps reword it so that we aviod using "us and thems".
 
 
 about us: 
 start with information that is not about us?
 i.e are you looking for a high quality, natual ice-cream?
